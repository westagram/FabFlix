The average times could potentially be faster than 1 thread since a thread might run a little faster than another when running the search.</td>

    <td>This case takes an average of 55 milliseconds to run a query, an average of 1.37 milliseconds to go through the entire search servlet, and an average of 1.26 milliseconds for JDBC execution. With 10 threads using HTTPS, it is pretty similar to HTTP.</td>

Without prepared statements, the JDBC execution and search servlets require double time compared to when prepared statements are used.</td>

It is clear that without connection pooling, the queries are all around are much slower since multiple connections cannot be handled as well all at once.</td>

Without connection pooling, even with the scaled version it takes a while to run queries because it can't handle multiple connections efficiently. Also it must go through a proxy, so it takes even longer.</td>
